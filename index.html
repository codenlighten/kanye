<p> My name is Kanye and I'm an approximately 8 month old Plott Hound / Mountain Cur pup. I originally came to SVASC as a stray that had been running around up on the mountain with my siblings. Camping trip gone awry, y'know. Anyways, now I'm stuck here at this shelter and I would much rather be chillin' at your place. I'm a very sweet, but shy pup. Staff at the shelter don't think that I spent much time around people prior to arriving, so I would love a family that can go slow with me. I have made tons of progress, though and I think that I would continue to improve in a home. I am great with other dogs and really enjoy their company. I also get along well with cats and older kids.</p>
